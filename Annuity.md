Certainly, I can provide a comprehensive tutorial on annuities, including sample questions and detailed solutions at different difficulty levels. 

**a. What is Annuity?**

An annuity is a series of equal periodic payments or receipts made at regular intervals. These payments can occur at the beginning or end of each period, depending on the type of annuity. Annuities are commonly used in various financial scenarios, including retirement planning, mortgage loans, and investment plans. There are two main types of annuities:

1. **Ordinary Annuity (End-of-Period Annuity):** Payments occur at the end of each period.

2. **Annuity Due (Beginning-of-Period Annuity):** Payments occur at the beginning of each period.

The key components of an annuity include:
- Payment amount (PMT): The equal periodic payment or receipt.
- Interest rate (i): The rate at which the annuity is compounded or discounted.
- Number of periods (n): The total number of payment periods.
- Present Value (PV): The current value of future annuity payments.
- Future Value (FV): The total value of the annuity at the end of the payment period.

**Simple Annuity Questions:**

**1. Question:** You want to save for a vacation by depositing $200 at the end of each month into a savings account earning an annual interest rate of 4%. How much will you have saved in 1 year?

**Solution:**
To calculate the future value of an ordinary annuity, you can use the formula for future value of an ordinary annuity:

\[FV = PMT \times \dfrac{(1 + i)^n - 1}{i}\]

Where:
- PMT = $200
- i (monthly interest rate) = 4% / 12 = 0.3333% or 0.003333 (as a decimal)
- n (number of months) = 12

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[FV = 200 \times \dfrac{(1 + 0.003333)^{12} - 1}{0.003333} \approx $2,430.71\]

**2. Question:** You have just won a lottery, and the prize is $500,000, to be paid out over 20 years with annual payments. What is the annual payment you will receive?

**Solution:**
To calculate the annual payment of an ordinary annuity, you can use the formula for the annual payment:

\[PMT = \dfrac{PV}{\dfrac{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}}{i}}\]

Where:
- PV = $500,000
- i (annual interest rate) = let's assume 5% or 0.05
- n (number of years) = 20

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[PMT = \dfrac{500,000}{\dfrac{1 - (1 + 0.05)^{-20}}{0.05}} \approx $46,100.28\]

**Medium Annuity Questions:**

**3. Question:** You want to purchase a car, and you can afford monthly payments of $350. If the annual interest rate is 6%, how long will it take to pay off a car loan of $20,000?

**Solution:**
To calculate the number of payment periods (n), you can use the formula for the number of periods in an ordinary annuity:

\[n = \dfrac{\log(\dfrac{PMT}{PMT - i \cdot PV})}{\log(1 + i)}\]

Where:
- PMT = $350
- i (monthly interest rate) = 6% / 12 = 0.5% or 0.005
- PV (loan amount) = $20,000

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[n = \dfrac{\log(\dfrac{350}{350 - 0.005 \cdot 20,000})}{\log(1 + 0.005)} \approx 48.85\]

You'll need approximately 49 months to pay off the car loan.

**4. Question:** You want to calculate the present value of an annuity that pays $1,000 at the end of each year for the next 5 years. If the discount rate is 8%, what is the present value?

**Solution:**
To calculate the present value (PV) of an ordinary annuity, you can use the formula for present value of an ordinary annuity:

\[PV = PMT \times \dfrac{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}}{i}\]

Where:
- PMT = $1,000
- i (discount rate) = 8% or 0.08
- n (number of years) = 5

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[PV = 1,000 \times \dfrac{1 - (1 + 0.08)^{-5}}{0.08} \approx $3,993.08\]

**Hard Annuity Questions:**

**5. Question:** You want to plan for retirement and need $1,000,000 in 20 years. If you can invest in an account that earns an annual interest rate of 7%, how much should you deposit at the end of each year to reach your goal?

**Solution:**
To calculate the annual deposit needed for a future value, you can use the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity:

\[PMT = \dfrac{FV \cdot i}{(1 + i)^n - 1}\]

Where:
- FV (future value goal) = $1,000,000
- i (annual interest rate) = 7% or 0.07
- n (number of years) = 20

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[PMT = \dfrac{1,000,000 \cdot 0.07}{(1 + 0.07)^{20} - 1} \approx $13,268.07\]

**6. Question:** You have an investment opportunity that offers an 8% annual interest rate. You want to calculate how much you can withdraw annually for 10 years, given an initial deposit of $100,000. What's the maximum annual withdrawal that ensures you don't run out of money?

**Solution:**
To calculate the maximum annual withdrawal for a given number of years, you can use the formula for the annuity payment:

\[PMT = \dfrac{PV \cdot i}{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}}\]

Where:
- PV (initial deposit) = $100,000
- i (annual interest rate) = 8% or 0.08
- n (number of years) = 10

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[PMT = \dfrac{100,000 \cdot 0.08}{1 - (1 + 0.08)^{-10}} \approx $16,434.08\]

**7. Question:** You want to save for your child's education, and you plan to make periodic deposits into an account. If you aim to have $50,000 in 15 years and the account pays an annual interest rate of 6%, how much should you deposit annually?

**Solution:**
To calculate the annual deposit needed for a future value, you can use the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity:

\[PMT = \dfrac{FV \cdot i}{(1 + i)^n - 1}\]

Where:
- FV (future value goal) = $50,000
- i (annual interest rate) = 6% or 0.06
- n (number of years) = 15

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[PMT = \dfrac{50,000 \cdot 0.06}{(1 + 0.06)^{15} - 1} \approx $2,625.42\]

**8. Question:** You have an annuity that will pay $1,000 per month for the next 10 years. If you can invest in a savings account that earns an annual interest rate of 5%, what is the present value of this annuity?

**Solution:**
To calculate the present value (PV) of an annuity with monthly payments, you can use the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity:

\[PV = PMT \times \dfrac{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}}{i}\]

Where:
- PMT (monthly payment) = $1,000
- i (monthly interest rate) = 5% / 12 = 0.4167% or 0.004167 (as a decimal)
- n (number of months) = 10 years * 12 months = 120

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[PV = 1,000 \times \dfrac{1 - (1 + 0.004167)^{-120}}{0.004167} \approx $106,928.68\]

**9. Question:** You want to calculate the future value of an annuity that pays $500 at the end of each month for the next 5 years. If the annual interest rate is 4%, what is the future value of this annuity?

**Solution:**
To calculate the future value (FV) of an annuity with monthly payments, you can use the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity:

\[FV = PMT \times \dfrac{(1 + i)^n - 1}{i}\]

Where:
- PMT (monthly payment) = $500
- i (monthly interest rate) = 4% / 12 = 0.3333% or 0.003333 (as a decimal)
- n (number of months) = 5 years * 12 months = 60

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[FV = 500 \times \dfrac{(1 + 0.003333)^{60} - 1}{0.003333} \approx $32,499.25\]

**10. Question:** You have a financial goal of saving $1,000,000 for your retirement in 30 years. If you can invest in an account that earns an annual interest rate of 6%, how much should you deposit annually to reach your goal?

**Solution:**
To calculate the annual deposit needed for a future value, you can use the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity:

\[PMT = \dfrac{FV \cdot i}{(1 + i)^n - 1}\]

Where:
- FV (future value goal) = $1,000,000
- i (annual interest rate) = 6% or 0.06
- n (number of years) = 30

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[PMT = \dfrac{1,000,000 \cdot 0.06}{(1 + 0.06)^{30} - 1} \approx $3,641.05\]
